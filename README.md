# NBA-CLI

Welcome to our GitHub Repository for our NBA CLI! This CLI comes with 4 features that allow you to:
  - Check upcoming games/previous games
  - Check live scores for games that are currently being played
  - Check boxscores for games that have ended
  - Check standings in the league
  
What we plan to add:
  -NBA news
  -Live boxscores
  -Additional bug fixes
  -Branch to other sports such as NFL NHL ETC...

For games that are currently going on, our project WILL show live scores!

We are happy to announce that we have realeased an EXE file of the program, so there is no need to download any modules or Python itself! All you have to do is head to our website: nba-cli.herokuapp.com and download it! View our Youtube video for instructions on installing it to the CLI.

Huge shoutout to http://stats.nesn.com/nba/ for providing us with reliable statistics!
