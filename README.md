# NBA-CLI

Welcome to our GitHub Repository for our NBA CLI! This CLI comes with 3 main programs that allow you to:
  - Check upcoming games/previous games
  - Check boxscores for games that have ended
  - Check standings in the league

For games that are currently going on, our project WILL show live scores!

We are happy to announce that we have realeased an EXE file of the program, so there is no need to download any modules or Python itself! All you have to do is head to our website: nba-cli.herokuapp.com and download it! View our Youtube video for instructions on installing it to the CLI.

Huge shoutout to http://stats.nesn.com/nba/ for providing us with reliable statistics!
