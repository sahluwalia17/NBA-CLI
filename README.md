# NBA-CLI

Welcome to our GitHub Repository for our NBA CLI! This CLI comes with 3 main programs that allow you to:
  - Check upcoming games/previous games
  - Check boxscores for games that have ended
  - Check standings in the league

For games that are currently going on, our project WILL show live scores!

Unfortunately in order to access this, you will need to have Python, pip installer, clint, requests, and cmd2 installed on your computer! 
As we still are in development, we at this time are not able to create an executable file that will take care of this for you.

If you take the time to install these modules, you will have access to a beautifully crafted CLI with custom colors that will elevate the 
user experience. We provide fast and reliable information that will never fail you!

Huge shoutout to http://stats.nesn.com/nba/ for providing us with reliable statistics!
